When I'm doing daily work in the shell, there are a number of cmdlets and associated arguments that I find myself typing often to discover new things and re-discover topics that I've previously covered. Maybe getting these written out with explanations and examples will help some of you while you learn PowerShell, however I do believe that these are useful regardless of your level of experience. You really never stop learning (and definitely never stop forgetting). There will always be situations where you need to go back to the basics, so to speak.
