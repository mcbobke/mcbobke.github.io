Hi! I'm Matt Bobke. I'm currently a Desktop Support Specialist at Blizzard Entertainment in Irvine, California. My Bachelors degree is in Computer Game Science, but I developed a passion for shell scripting and automation during my time studying computer science. Currently, my homelab project takes up most of my free time as I explore the wide-reaching realms of automation and administration, with some development thrown in the mix.

I like to make computers do my bidding through PowerShell. I fell in love with PowerShell after getting my first IT job and realizing that could take my knowledge of software engineering and make so many things happen on their own. I want to share my experiences with PowerShell and other tools with readers, both so that they can learn from my mistakes and so that I can reinforce my own learning.
