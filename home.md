title: Scripting Secures Success

## About Me

Hi! I'm Matt Bobke. I'm currently an IT Systems Administrator at ERI Economic Research Institute in Irvine, California. My Bachelors degree is in Computer Game Science, but I developed a passion for shell scripting and systems administration during my time studying Computer Science.

I fell in love with PowerShell after getting my first IT job and realizing that I could take what I learned from my Computer Science and software engineering courses and apply it to developing scripts that are useful in an enterprise IT environment. I want to share my experiences with PowerShell and other tools with readers, both so that they can learn from my mistakes and so that I can reinforce my own learning.

## Projects
